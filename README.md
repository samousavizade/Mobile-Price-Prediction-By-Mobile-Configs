# Mobile Price Prediction by Specifications

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict mobile phone prices based on various technical specifications. Using a dataset that includes features like RAM, internal memory, battery power, and more, the project employs different machine learning models to estimate the price category of mobile phones.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains several features related to mobile phone specifications, such as:
- RAM
- Internal Memory
- Battery Power
- Screen Size
- Camera Quality
- and many others...

The target variable is the price category of the phone.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To explore and understand the relationship between various phone specifications and their pricing.
2. To develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the price category of a mobile phone based on its specifications.

## Methodology
Several machine learning models were used in this project, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each model's performance was evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The results section should include a summary of the model performances. Highlight the model that performed the best and discuss any insights gained from the model evaluations.

## Conclusions
Provide a summary of the key findings of this project, including the most important features influencing mobile phone prices and the most effective model(s) for prediction.

## Future Work
Suggestions for future work might include:
- Trying more advanced models or ensemble methods.
- Incorporating additional features, such as brand reputation or release year.
- Applying the models to predict actual price values instead of price categories.

## How to Use
Instructions on how to run the project, including installation steps, dependencies, and execution commands.
